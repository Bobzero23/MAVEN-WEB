/*I AM A LITTLE LATE FOR TAKING NOTES BUT I WILL DO MY BEST
 * 
 * WHAT IS MAVEN
 * Maven is a tool that we java developer use to work with other platform and other languages like
 * let's say you wanna work with mysql we need to download the Mysql Connector Jar file and 
 * all these jar files called dependencies so Maven help us to get those Jar files..
 * 
 * EVERY TIME YOU WORK WITH MAVEN YOU GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED WITH INTERNET
 * Because everytime you use maven for the first time it has to download the jar files from the remote repository
 * And aslo it has local repository so that the good thing right, coz we dont have to use it all the time
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * TO RUN MAVEN WEB APP WITH EMBEDDED JETTY
 * You gonna have to put some plugins and also you need to use configuration tag
 * for more info check the pom.xml file in the plugins you will see what I mean
